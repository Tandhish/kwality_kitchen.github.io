## Instructions

* The main will contain a merged copy of the <br>
  * Front End (Websites mostly)
  * Back End (Server side mostly)
  * Database (Database structures, Blueprints, Schemas)
  
* Due to freeware restrictions, we cannot stop you from pushing you into the main branch. So, make sure you only upload to the branches you are supposed to upload on.

* To upload into a branch:

  1. Make sure your branch is created (Just check the github repository through GitHub and click on branch).
  2. If branch exists, open `Git Bash` on your project folder and type `git switch <branch-name>`
  3. Once you confirm you are on the correct branch, follow these steps (do all of these whenever you want to push changes):
    * `git pull`
    * `git add *`
    * `git commit -m "<message>"`     
    * `git push origin <branchname>`
    
    Note: If you want to directly push to branch without changing your local branch, you can simply do `git push origin <localbranch>:<remotebranch>`
